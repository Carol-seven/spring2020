      different notations)
	+ Learn from each other --- the repos are all public

# 04/24

A project presentation is different from topic presentation

+ Project presentation focuses on your research question
    - Why is it important?
	- What's been done?
	- What's your contribution?
	- What're the take-home messages?
	- It is a research presentation as in a research conference
	    + Focus on results
		+ Skip implementations unless the implementation is your
          research quesitons like in statistical computing
+ A project progress report can report unsolved problems, potential
  solutions, fall-back plans, discussion on limitations of the current
  methods.
